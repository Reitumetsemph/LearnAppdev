This app is for a fully functional app that uses Flutter and django
I wanna use a T-SQL data base but mongodb and postgreSQL was suggested:
    this was suggested to be for user data, schedules, and ticket/cards
I need to get the API's for the publice transport to get real time data
we can use figma for the User interface
